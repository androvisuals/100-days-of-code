# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: APRIL 6 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: After encountering the ArrayList class in "head first java" I decided to explore what the differences were compared to a standard array.
**Advantages**:
- Being able to dynamically alter the size of the array list is one of the most powerful features.
- Sorting through Arraylists and being able to insert a new index.
- An arraylist can also work with objects.
- Removing an index is not possible with a standard array.

**Thoughts:** Glad I've resumed my studies with "Head first Java" since a week ago. All the things I'd previously learned have pretty much stuck, still going through the previous 5 chapters was a good refresher.
Started my cheat sheet in Google docs.
