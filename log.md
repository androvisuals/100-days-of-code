# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: APRIL 6 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: After encountering the ArrayList class in "head first java" I decided to explore what the differences were compared to a standard array.
**Advantages**:
- Being able to dynamically alter the size of the array list is one of the most powerful features.
- Sorting through Arraylists and being able to insert a new index.
- An arraylist can also work with objects.
- Removing an index is not possible with a standard array.

**Thoughts:** Glad I've resumed my studies with "Head first Java" since a week ago. All the things I'd previously learned have pretty much stuck, still going through the previous 5 chapters was a good refresher.
Started my cheat sheet in Google docs.

### Day 1: APRIL 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: More studies with the ArrayList object this time using strings, studied more with lookups, creating arrayLists of objects and then calling methods on the objects inside of the arraylist.
Last but not least how to replace objects in an arrayList with other objects.

**Thoughts:** It's all becoming a lot more natural now with finding errors and understanding how to solve them quickly.

### Day 2: APRIL 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic study with class based inheritance. Kept it very simple to test the use of extend.
Pure test code so nothing really useful. 

**Thoughts:** Great starting method to avoid using duplicate code in a class and being able to overwrite a method from a superclass.
