# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: APRIL 6 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: After encountering the ArrayList class in "head first java" I decided to explore what the differences were compared to a standard array.
**Advantages**:
- Being able to dynamically alter the size of the array list is one of the most powerful features.
- Sorting through Arraylists and being able to insert a new index.
- An arraylist can also work with objects.
- Removing an index is not possible with a standard array.

**Thoughts:** Glad I've resumed my studies with "Head first Java" since a week ago. All the things I'd previously learned have pretty much stuck, still going through the previous 5 chapters was a good refresher.
Started my cheat sheet in Google docs.

### Day 1: APRIL 7 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: More studies with the ArrayList object this time using strings, studied more with lookups, creating arrayLists of objects and then calling methods on the objects inside of the arraylist.
Last but not least how to replace objects in an arrayList with other objects.

**Thoughts:** It's all becoming a lot more natural now with finding errors and understanding how to solve them quickly.

### Day 2: APRIL 8 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic study with class based inheritance. Kept it very simple to test the use of extend.
Pure test code so nothing really useful. 

**Thoughts:** Great starting method to avoid using duplicate code in a class and being able to overwrite a method from a superclass.

### Day 3: APRIL 9 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on creating a system which generates a string made from random characters from a pre defined list with the alphabet and numbers 0-9.
This was then added to a system which allows any number of them to be generated and then put into an arraylist.

**Thoughts:** This will be the first step in me figuring out how to get random data with a seed so the same results can be created, then I want to write this to a file and start experimenting with encrypting the data.

### Day 4: APRIL 10 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with the system from yesterday. Now the system can generate the same pseudo random results with a seed number. 
Working on implementing a way to write the final ArrayList into a text file.
Managed to get the relative path of the current java file to be written as a string so that the future text file will be in a logical location.

**Thoughts:** There are many different methods to write things to file, basically a lot of time went into this with little to show for it today. Learnt a lot though. Think I'll continue with the org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils as it seems to be a more modern implementation of older java classes.

### Day 5: APRIL 11 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a script which creates a text file and then writes strings into it. Also uses try catch exception. 

**Thoughts:** Slow going again. Stopped using sublime text 3 and started again with java eclipse so it took a while to get familiar with it and get it all working again. Going to have to study more exception based programming. Going to combine this with the pseudo random string generator once i've figured out how to clear a file and read its contents.

### Day 6: APRIL 12 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a basic script which plays two wav files from the hard drive after each other.

**Thoughts:** The Java documentation really misses any clear examples for anything from the javax library, very slow going. Still have a lot to learn about how to navigate through certain parts of the site. Still studying head first with java, busy with polymorphism.

### Day 7: APRIL 13 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a script that converts a loaded image into an array of bytes, I wanted to shuffle the array and make a new image out of it to see some random glitch stuff. Only got as far to make it load an image into a array of bytes and then save a new image to drive from that array. Scrambler part will have to come later.

**Thoughts:** This was pretty hard, I have a lot to learn about "streams" and what that actually means in the bigger picture. Learnt a lot though about how picture image can be represented.

### Day 8: APRIL 14 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back to basic arrayLists this time doing some testing with Abstract classes and methods in the mix.

**Thoughts:** Decided to go back to the basics, need to learn a lot more advanced stuff before i can do the image scrambler stuff. The abstract parts make total sense to get working, but I'm missing some real world scenarios where I'd apply them. Sure that'll come later.

### Day 9: APRIL 15 , 2018

**Today's Progress**: Basic script which requests the user to type intput into the console and then displays it. Continues until the user types in quit.

**Thoughts:** Struggled with this one today, a few simple things like input == "quit" didn't work as they compare the reference, needed to be .equals. etc etc. Think I'll carry on more with the user console things for the next few days.
